Merry Christmas everybody!

Christmas is the time of joy that everyone can be a part of, regardless of their religion.
Whatever faith you have, whether you're a Buddhist, a Muslim, or any other religions,
please be happy and enjoy the festivity.

Merry Christmas to and from all Unitarians in Thailand.
